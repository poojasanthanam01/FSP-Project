# Flight Schedule Pro: Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases two case study projects built for Flight Schedule Pro (FSP), using SQL, BigQuery, and Looker Studio to surface actionable insights in aviation training operations. These projects reflect my ability to explore operational bottlenecks, design experiments, and deliver business-ready visualizations that drive strategic decisions.
