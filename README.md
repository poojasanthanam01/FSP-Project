# Flight Schedule Pro: Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases two case study projects built for Flight Schedule Pro (FSP), using SQL, BigQuery, and Looker Studio to surface actionable insights in aviation training operations. These projects reflect my ability to explore operational bottlenecks, design experiments, and deliver business-ready visualizations that drive strategic decisions.

## What's Included

1. **Aircraft Utilization & Scheduling Optimization**  
   - Modeled aircraft booking data to calculate utilization rates  
   - Created booking heatmaps to identify underused time blocks  
   - Proposed redistribution strategies to improve throughput

2. **Student Progress Bottleneck Analysis**  
   - Analyzed milestone drop-off and average delays between training stages  
   - Created a training funnel, delay chart, and dropout vs certified comparison  
   - Recommended KPI dashboards and early intervention triggers
